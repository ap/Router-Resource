Revision history for Perl extension Router::Resource.

      - Fixed the headers returned on method lookup failure: they should not
        have been in a double array ref. So now instead of something like
        `[[Allow => 'GET, HEAD']]`, the headers are properly set to
        `[Allow => 'GET, HEAD']`, and therefore parseable by HTTP::Headers.
