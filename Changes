0.20  Tue 10 Mar 2015
      - Added the `auto_options` option, which will auto-generate an `OPTIONS`
        method for each resource. Thanks to Chris Reinhardt for the pull
        request!
      - Removed Pod tests from the distribution.

0.11  Wed 29 Dec 2010
      - Fixed the headers returned on method lookup failure: they should not
        have been in a double array ref. So now instead of something like
        `[[Allow => 'GET, HEAD']]`, the headers are properly set to
        `[Allow => 'GET, HEAD']`, and therefore parseable by HTTP::Headers.
